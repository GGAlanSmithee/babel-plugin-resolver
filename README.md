# babel-plugin-resolver
Automatic resolution of plugins needed for es2015 compatability for a given browser / environment

**OBS! This is a *very* WIP, mostly untested and likely to be broken for as long as you see this warning!**

## Try it
* Edit `index.js` and run it with `node index` and see the various `.babelrc` files that are generated
* There is no transpiling of the code atm but some es2015 features in use - use node v5.0.0!

## Contribute
* contributions are more than welcome :)
* target the `dev` branch with PR:s
* the code was hacked away in a huge hurry - sorry!
